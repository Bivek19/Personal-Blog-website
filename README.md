To use this project in your localhost
you need to install node.js
I have used express js here which is a minimal, open source and flexible Node. js web app framework designed to make developing websites, web apps, & API's much easier.
Download the following files
open the terminal
Go to the project folder(cd to the project folder)
type- npm install (to install all the dependencies)
to run the server type- node app.js
